## Overview

This is a simple todo app that lets users create and customize a to-do list.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Delete todos from the list
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascipt

### What I learned

I really learnt alot. Especially strengthening my array knowledge, which was honed while I implemented it on a local storage. I also learnt a proper use of functions, as well as an in depth knowledge of DOM manipulation, since a huge part of the project was created with Javascript.

```Js
let saveArray = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('todo')) || [];
/*This goes a long way in helping me learn how to store data on the front end. It's something I'm really proud of*/
```


### Continued development

I really would like to work more on understanding the DOM, storing data and accessing them as required.



### Useful resources

- [resource 1]ChatGPT - This helped me in arranging my code into a re-usable function. It also helped in my debugging process.I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com) - This amazing website helped me to understand the use of icons. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept and all other CSS concepts.
